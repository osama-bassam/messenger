i wanna create android application  using android studio , java , xml 
the application idea is :
message app , there is only username and its not necessary to be your real name ,
 its just used to find you whaen somebody search with it , anyone can text you if
 he have ur user name , this is the only way to meassage u by this app  (security reasons) ,
 once the message arrived to the other side (user) and once the user road it it will disappear
 after a period of time (it depends on message size) to ensure when finish reading it, it will
 disappear , message content cant be shown in notifications , user have to click on it to read it ,
 users can send text and photos and videos and all disappear after watch it , when user get out
 from the app every thing will be deleted except usernames for who's contact with u
 (only usernames names without content) , users have the choice to delete even usernames 
who's talk with , but a pop-out alert will notify that they have to save the username in
 their mind ,users names have to be unique , ill chose the notification icont and other 
icons , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,write a documentation for this project ,, add a steps that u
 see its good or remove the bad details , make the project a life , add a value to it , 
the result in word file plese






i deelted all projects files except the icon , and the firebase is linked as u see,
 i wanna start from zero again , lets start step by step with the UI , lets make a
 login and signup buttons with username and password fields , when signup , the data
 will go to the firebase, (u will implement how) and when sign in , the app will search 
for the usename entered in the database and will return if enter or not (to the app) 
when enter the app , a chat list will be displayed , at the first time and before any chat
 , an empty chat bar will be shown , a search box for find friends by their user name will 
be there , to add the first friend , this is initally
