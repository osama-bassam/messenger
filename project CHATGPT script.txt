i wanna create android application  using android studio , java , xml 
the application idea is :
message app , there is only username and its not necessary to be your real name ,
 its just used to find you whaen somebody search with it , anyone can text you if
 he have ur user name , this is the only way to meassage u by this app  (security reasons) ,
 once the message arrived to the other side (user) and once the user road it it will disappear
 after a period of time (it depends on message size) to ensure when finish reading it, it will
 disappear , message content cant be shown in notifications , user have to click on it to read it ,
 users can send text and photos and videos and all disappear after watch it , when user get out
 from the app every thing will be deleted except usernames for who's contact with u
 (only usernames names without content) , users have the choice to delete even usernames 
who's talk with , but a pop-out alert will notify that they have to save the username in
 their mind ,users names have to be unique , ill chose the notification icont and other 
icons , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,write a documentation for this project ,, add a steps that u
